"""JioFarm — GrizzlySMS Refund Worker.

Background thread that cancels failed activations to reclaim balance.

Two modes:
- **normal** — wait the full delay, then cancel (for OTP timeout cases)
- **aggressive** — retry every 30s starting immediately, cancel as soon as the
  GrizzlySMS lock window opens (for fast-fail cases like "not a subscriber")
